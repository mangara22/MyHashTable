# MyHashTable

## Description:
A *basic* implementation of a **HashTable**.
 - Used **Linked Lists** for *separate chaining*
 - Implemented a resize method that makes the HashTable bigger based on a *load factor of 0.75*
 - Contains a file named `HashTableTest.java` which utilizes **JUnit 5** for testing some of the methods

## Assumptions:
 - The user will not type in random letters for an argument in the console
 - The user will save their HashTable to a `.txt` file *only*

## Extra Things Used:
 - Java Generics
 - PrintWriter for saving to a file
 - JUnit 5 for testing

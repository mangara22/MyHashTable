# MyHashTable

## Description:
This is a *basic* implementation of a **HashTable**, *don't expect anything too fancy*.

## Assumptions:
 - The user will enter an `int` and `strings` when prompted
 - The user will enter two arguments when doing `add`, `hashcode`, `contains`, etc.
 
## Inspiration:
 - Decided to make my own basic implementation of a HashTable in `Java` based on other CSCI classes.
 - **CSCI 1933 Project 5**: similar code for `add`, `hash`, `print`
 - **CSCI 2021 Project 1 Problem 3**: implemented a "console" with different `commands`, except not in `C`

## Extra Things:
 - Uses `Java Generics`

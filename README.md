# MyHashTable

## Description:
This is a *basic* implementation of a **HashTable**, *don't expect anything too fancy*.

## Assumptions:
 - The user will not type in random gibberish for commands in the console
 - The user will save their HashTable to a `.txt` file
 
## Inspiration:
 - Decided to make my own basic implementation of a HashTable in `Java` based on other CSCI classes.
 - **CSCI 1933 Project 5**: similar code for `add`, `hash`, `print`
 - **CSCI 2021 Project 1 Problem 3**: similar implementation of a "console" with different `commands`, except not in `C`

## Extra Things Used:
 - `Java Generics`
 - `Switch` Statements
 - `Try-Catch` for input error handling
 - `PrintWriter` and `File` for saving to a file
